# DriverPass

**Summary**
The goal of the DriverPass project was to create a web-based system for the client that enabled their costumers to learn the material needed to pass their driving exam online. They needed a system where customers could book driving lessons, access online training materials, and take practice tests. The system also had to handle lesson scheduling, user role management, and secure data access across various user types, including customers, secretaries, and admins. 

**Successes**
One aspect that I think went particularly well was the diagrams and models created to assist in the design and development of the DriverPass system. For example, user role-based access was a large part of the functionality of the system. Breaking down each user’s access and responsibilities, I made it clear how each user type would interact with the system, from customers scheduling their lessons to IT officers managing accounts. This structure provided a solid foundation for understanding how each piece of the system fits together.

**Improvements**
If I could go back and improve one part of my work, I’d revise the UML activity diagrams. While it covers the main processes, it isn’t as thorough as I would like. I’d add more detail to cover various scenarios, particularly edge cases like handling driver and car unavailability, it may have been more productive to add loop aspect. This added depth would help make the design more robust and guide future developers in handling these alternative flows effectively. But there were parts of the system left out of the activity diagram and that is my biggest regret. 

**User Needs and System Design**
Understanding and integrating DriverPass’s needs into the system was all about anticipating what each user would require from the platform. I focused on each user type’s perspective. For example, customers needed an easy way to book and manage lessons, while the admins needed tools for monitoring accounts and handling access rights. Meeting these specific needs is crucial because a system’s success depends on how well it serves its users. When the design aligns with user expectations and tasks, it creates a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

**My Approach to Software Design**
My approach to software design involves breaking down requirements, mapping out user’s needs, and then focusing on the technical details. Moving forward, I plan to place even more emphasis on usability testing and getting early feedback to ensure the design meets real user needs. I’d also incorporate techniques like creating user personas and running scenario-based tests to refine the design from a user-centered perspective. By focusing on these methods, I aim to build systems that aren’t just functional but also intuitive and valuable for end users.
